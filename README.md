Not here to sate your personal vendettas. Converse with respect, maintain grid st-

"TALKR: reply- "historically they have a tendency to buy out the best hacktivists 
and use them to run counterops, look at 333 for a good example of that. used to be 
fucked with every week, now it just gets a big hit every year from some dipshit 
SH0GVNN3R5 going thru intiiation" 

"SYNCDIN - "Rosemary Pauline West age 65 years old born in Northam, UK, graduated 
University of Chicago at Westford dual major in Computer Science & Political Science, 
arrest record expunged due to the Talent Acquisition & Public Infrastructure Act. Cu-
-rently employed by m0S as Grid Moderator for USSA Grid #333."

>"TRAVLR - "Rosemary, reviewing 'California Earthquake" adventure construct - 

Honestly, scared the shit out of me and my ma, but it was really fun to be able to r-
escure folks from a cataclysm. Definitely some wonderful memories made of my ma lift-
-ing a segment of highway in order to save a bus full of children. Glitches around 
some of the billboards should be fixed though tbh."

"Rosemary, reviewing 'Bahama Mama' vacation construct -

My mom loved it! 9/10 would visit again, but my reccomendation is to mix yourself a 
Gin & Tandi before you head in as being slightly drunk for the karaoke segment is a 
must. Great opportunity to meet new pen pals from around the grid too!"
